Ultralist is a task management system for technical people. It is command-line component that is very fast and stays out of the way. 

Ultralist is based off of the [Getting Things Done](gtd) system. It has a concept of due dates, projects, and contexts.

Combined with [ultralist.io](https://ultralist.io), Ultralist provides a superior task management experience to Wunderlist, Todoist, etc.  The command-line will app _always_ be first and foremost.

**See the [ultralist docs][tdl] for the all documentation.**

## Is it good?

Yes.  Yes it is.

## Installation

* **Mac OS**: Run `brew install ultralist`.
* **Other systems**: Get the correct ultralist binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/ultralist/ultralist/releases).
* If you have Golang installed: Run `go get github.com/ultralist/ultralist`.

Then, follow the [quick start](https://docs.ultralist.io/quickstart.html) in the docs to quickly get up and running.

## How does Ultralist relate to ultralist.io?

* `ultralist` is this tool.
* [ultralist.io](https://ultralist.io) is an enhancement service to the `ultralist` tool.  It allows for synchronization between computers, a great web view of your todolists, and (eventual) phone apps.  Ultralist.io is currently in a free public beta.


## How is this different from todo.txt?

[todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) is great.  But it didn't work well for my needs.

Here's how ultralist compares specifically to todo.txt:
1. **Due dates.** they are a core concept of ultralist but not todo.txt.
1. **Synchronizing.** Syncing is built into the CLI using the [ultralist.io](https://ultralist.io) service.
1. **Active development.** the ultralist CLI is under active development, whereas todo.txt's CLI is not.
